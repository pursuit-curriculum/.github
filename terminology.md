# Terminology

The following terms are used regularly throughout this document and throughout the Pursuit organization.

## Learning objective

A learning objective is an actionable task that should be attainable by a student. Ideally, learning objectives are specific, concise, and measurable.

For example, a good learning objective could be the following:

- Identify the name, parameters, and body of a given function.

This learning objective is useful for a variety of reasons. First, it has a clear action associated with it. Based on this learning objective students must be able to identify parts of a function. Second, it is concise but full; it points out the most important parts of a function that must be identified.
Finally, it is measurable in that an instructor could ask a student to perform this task and immediately get feedback on whether or not a student is able to complete this task.

## Learning outcome

A learning outcome should “describe or list essential, measurable mastered content, reflecting skills, competencies, and knowledge that students can demonstrate successfully upon completing a course.” They are designed to convey what students can do with the specific knowledge and skills they’ve obtained.

A learning outcome differs from a learning objective in a few ways. In particular, outcomes typically express higher-level thinking skills than objectives. It’s helpful to think of outcomes as the big takeaways or selling points of what a student can do upon successful completion of the program.

For example, take the following learning outcome:

- Students are able to build JavaScript programs that accurately solve simple mathematical problems.

In order for a fellow to be able to do this, they would need to be able to complete a number of learning objectives:

- Manipulate numbers with common methods and tools.
- Create functions with parameters using the function declaration syntax.
- Call functions with arguments.
- Return values from functions.
- Create and assign values to variables.
- Use arithmetic operators to build simple mathematical equations.

Another important component of learning outcomes is that they must be able to be assessed in order to demonstrate mastery of the outcome. For example, the learning outcome above could be assessed by requiring students to build a series of functions that make up a calculator.

## Learning goal

A learning goal represents a high-level concept that groups together multiple outcomes and objectives. You can think of a learning goal as a “unit title” with a brief description, encompassing a variety of skills and knowledge.

For example, a good learning goal could be the following:

- _Back-end development:_ Students should be able to build database-backed servers.

The title of _Back-end development_ describes a broad set of skills while providing context. The brief description adds a bit more detail as to what  is being taught.

## Mastery

Mastery means that students are able to reproduce the assigned learning objective with minimal assistance and within an amount of time that is either explicitly defined or appropriate to an individual at their level.

For example, take the following learning objective:

- Create arrays with the array literal syntax.

A fellow who has mastered this concept should be able to:

- Complete the task at hand (i.e. create an array using the specified syntax).
- Describe what an array is.
- Describe what “array literal” means.

However, based on this learning objective alone a fellow does not need to be able to:

- Define the memory implications for using an array.
- Perform any manipulations on that array.
- Connect the concept of an array to other programming concepts.

Put another way, mastery means that students are able to fully understand and complete a learning objective; no more, no less.

It’s important to keep in mind that once a fellow achieves mastery, it does not necessarily mean that they will stay at the same level of mastery. Regular practice and engagement is required to maintain mastery with any learning objective.

## Module or unit

A module or unit represents both of the following:

- A small set of learning goals.
- A defined set of time in the program.

For example, a _Back-end development_ module could be scheduled for 8 weeks and could cover five to six learning goals. All content within a module should be loosely related to an overarching theme.
